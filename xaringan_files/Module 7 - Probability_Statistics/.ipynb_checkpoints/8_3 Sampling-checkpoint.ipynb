    "When you can't collect data from an entire population, sampling is performed to collect a representative \"sample\" of the whole population. Even in relatively small populations, the data may be needed urgently, and including everyone in the population in your data collection may take too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability sampling is based on the fact that every member of a population has a known and equal chance of being selected. For example, if you had a population of 100 people, each person would have odds of 1 out of 100 of being chosen. With non-probability sampling, those odds are not equal. For example, a person might have a better chance of being chosen if they live close to the researcher or have access to a computer. \n",
