#Overview
There will be a total of five two-hour sessions in this course. Today we will cover the Python Basics and will use JupyterLab. 

In the next four sessions we will cover the follwoing key steps of a typical Data Analytics Project : 
- Import raw dataset into analytics environment  - Session 2
- Explore & Visualize - Session 2, 3, 4
- Perform Data Cleaning - Session 2, 3
- Perform Feature Selection and simple model development - Session 3, 4
- Analyze the results - Session 4
- Present findings - Session 4, 5

# Using JupyterLab


- Log on to your Unix Terminal

--

- To launch the JupyterLab, just type 
```python
jupyter lab
```

--
- You can access JupyterLab by entering the URL printed in the terminal after you run the jupyter lab command. It looks like the following. JupyterLab should open automatically in your browser if you are using Macbook 

 http://localhost:8888/?token=alongalphanumericnumber=alongalphanumericnumber.
 
 ####Let's take 5 minutes to get familiar with the JupyterLab
 - Open a notebook, add few cells, run `3 + 5` and save the notebook. Explore left pane and menu buttons

.footnote[
[1] For your home computer, visit the https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html to see the latest instruction on how to install JupyterLab.
]
---
#Markdown For Documenting Analytics
- A cell can be converted to a markdown cell from menu
##Header with single "#"
### Subheader with double "##" and so on
- Supports HTML and LaTex

- Bullets can be typed with "-" and

- LaTeX inside "$ $", for example "\int_0^\infty" inside dollar signs will be $\int_0^\infty$

# Python Overview

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Python.svg/1920px-Python.svg.png" alt="Sharingan" width="90" />

- Currently the most popular programming language

- It is powerful and few lines of code can do job where other langauges can take 3 to 5 times more codes

- It can be a glue language that can be used in-between other language or components

- It can be used almost in any domain and can run everywhere

- Open source and its easy to learn

# Python Types

- Python types are dynamic typing, so you do not need to declare.

#### Common Types
- Int – Any integers or whole numbers like 1, 2, 89 ; Float – 2.171892
- Bool – True of False
- Str, unicode – ‘MyString’, u‘MyString’
- List     – [ 69, 6.9, ‘mystring’, True]
- Tuple – (69,  6.9, ‘mystring’, True) immutable
- Set – set([69, 6.9, ‘str’, True]) –no duplicates & unordered
- Dictionary – {‘key 1’: 6.9, ‘key2’: False} - group of key-value pairs

```python
x=1
y= 1.23
p=True
Name="Mike"
print (x, y, p, Name)

```
    1 1.23  True Mike
    <class 'int'> <class 'float'> <class 'bool'> <class 'str'>
---
# Python Syntax
* Python uses indentation and/or whitespace to delimit statement blocks 
* Whitespace within lines does not matter
* End-of-Line terminates a statement


```python
if 10 > 7:
  print      ("Ten is greater than seven.")
```

    Ten is greater than seven.


* Comments are marked by #


```python
# But you do not need the syntax mentioned in the  syntax just to print; you need this to develop programs with python
print ("Hello Python") 
```

    Hello Python
---
# Quiz

# Using Loops, Conditions and Functions

---
## For Loop

range(start, stop[, step])  where step defaults to 1.

.pull-left[

```python
for i in range(0,10):

     print(i)
        
```

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
]

.pull-right[

```python
for i in range(0,7,2):

    print(i)
```

    0
    2
    4
    6

```python
for i in range(1,10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print (i)
```


]
---
.pull-left[
## While Loop
```python
i=0
while i < 12:

     print(i)

     i+=3
```
    
    0
    3
    6
    9
]
.pull-right[
## For Loop with If Condition

```python
for i in range(0,10):

    if i % 2 == 0:

        print(i)
```

    0
    2
    4
    6
    8
]  


- Python supports to have an else statement with a loop statement.

# Function

Functions are block of codes that are written once and can be called any time when needed. Python functions are defined using the word `def` as shown below:

    


```python
def function_name(parameters):
     """docstring"""
     statement(s)
     return statement
```


Argumants can be passed in the function as shown below:

.pull-left[
```python
def with_args(arg1=0,arg2=['a', 5]):
    """ A function with arguments """
    num = arg1 + 3
    mylist = arg2 + ['b',10]
    return [num, mylist]
with_args()
```
    [3, ['a', 5, 'b', 10]]
]

.pull-right[
#### What would this print?
```python
with_args(5)
```
]

---
## Function (Contd.)
```python
def with_args(arg1=0,arg2=['a', 5]):
    """ A function with arguments """
    num = arg1 + 3
    mylist = arg2 + ['b',10]
    return [num, mylist]
with_args(5)
```
  [8, ['a', 5, 'b', 10]]

#### What about this?

```python
with_args(10, ['x',6])
```
--
    [13, ['x', 6, 'b', 10]]
--
---
## Function (Contd.)
```python
def with_args(arg1=0,arg2=['a', 5]):
    """ A function with arguments """
    num = arg1 + 3
    mylist = arg2 + ['b',10]
    return [num, mylist]

```
#### Docstring in Function

```python
# A Docstring is the first statement in the body of a function, which can be accessed with function_name.__doc__ 

with_args.__doc__
```


    ' A function with arguments '
---
#Quiz
Which one is true?
1. The first code block will print 5 and 4.
2. The second code block will print 4 and 5
3. The first code block will print only 5 and function name with address
4. The second code blcok will print only 5 and function name with address

```python
def num():
    num = 5
    print(num)
num = 4
num()
print(num)
```
```python
num = 4
def num():
    num = 5
    print(num)

num()
print(num)
```
---
## Lambda
A lambda function is a small anonymous function. It can take any number of arguments, but allow only one expression.

```python
x = lambda a, b : a + b 
print(x(5, 7))
```
    12

The usefullness of lambda is shown below by using them as an anonymous function inside another function.

```python

def dup_or_double(n):  
    return lambda x : x * n

result = dup_or_double (2) 

double = result (50) 
print (double) 
```
    100


---


## Built-in Functions


```python
#lower(), upper()
word = 'Hello'

print (word, word.lower(), word.upper())
```
    Hello hello HELLO
    
```python
#Concatenation

print ('1' +'2')

print ('Hello' + ' there')

```
'12'
<br>
'Hello there'

---

## Built-in Functions (Contd.)

```python
#Concatenation with join() method 
#The method join() returns a string in which the string elements of sequence are joined by str separator.
str_separator=' '
list =['I', 'am', 'learning']
str_separator.join(list)
#or ' '.join(list)
```

    'I am learning'



```python
#split

s = 'Let\'s split the words'

s.split(' ')
```


    ["Let's", 'split', 'the', 'words']

# Part 2
# Using List, Tuple and Dictionaries

---
# List
List are most flexible and multipurpose data type in Python. It is defined using square bracket and can easily be accessed  and modified.

.pull-left[ 
```python
list = [11,22,33]

list
```
    [11, 22, 33]

```python
list[1]
```
    22
    
```python
list [0]
```
    11
]

.pull-right[ 

#### What is the value of the following?

list[3]

```python
#Update
list[2]=100
list
```
    [11, 22, 100]

```python
list.append(33)
list
```
    [11, 22, 100, 33]
]

---
## List (Contd.)
.pull-left[ 
```python
#Looping through a list
for i in list:
    print(i)
```
    11
    22
    100
    33
```python
#deleting an element
list.remove(100)
list
```
    [11, 22, 33]
]
--
.pull-right[ 
```python
list = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
for x,y in zip(list, list2):
    print(x,", ",y)
```
    1 ,  4
    2 ,  5
    3 ,  6
    
```python
#Guess what will be printed value for y
x = [10,20,30]
y = x
x[1] = 42
print(y)
```
]
--
.pull-right[ 
 [10, 42, 30]
 ]

---
# Tuple

- Tuples are useful for parallel computing when you do not want something to be changed by a worker process

```python
#Looks same as list
tuple1 = ('FRM',350, 'SF','FL')
tuple1
```
    ('FRM', 350, 'SF', 'FL')

- But they are immutable and if the following statement is run, you will get an error message stating - "TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment"
<br>
<br>
`tuple1[3]= 'VA'`

---
# Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are one of the most widely used data types that makes Python powerful and effective for accessing and manipulating data.

.pull-left[
```python
#Defining a python dictionary

iphonePrice = {
    'iphone5' : 200,
    'iphone6' : 300,
    'iphone8' : 700,
    'iphonex' : 900   }
```

```python
#accessing an element
iphonePrice["iphonex"]
```

    900
]

.pull-right[
```python
#adding an element
iphonePrice['iphone7']=500
iphonePrice
```

    {'iphone5': 200,
     'iphone6': 300,
     'iphone8': 700,
     'iphonex': 900,
     'iphone7': 500}

]

# List and Dictionary Comprehension

Comrehension is a way to build list or dictionaries quickly

```python
list = [i**2 for i in range(1, 11)]
list 
```
    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

```python
import random
list= [random.randint(0,5) for i in range (1, 10)]
list
```
    [3, 0, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2]

```python
dict= {i : i**3 for i in range (1, 10)}
dict
```
    {1: 1, 2: 8, 3: 27, 4: 64, 5: 125, 6: 216, 7: 343, 8: 512, 9: 729 }

# Excercise 
2. Use python list for text manipulation. <br>
(a) Create a python list using the words in this senetence:  `Fannie Mae head office is at DC`. <br>
(b) Then replace the third (head) and last elements (DC) of the list with `Technology` and `Reston`. <br>
(c) Convert to list to `'Fannie Mae Technology office is at Reston'` and print the result

---
## Solution
```python
s= "Fannie Mae head office is at DC"
s=s.split()
list=s
list
```
    ['Fannie', 'Mae', 'head', 'office', 'is', 'at', 'DC']

```python
list.remove('head')
list.remove('DC')
list
```
    ['Fannie', 'Mae', 'office', 'is', 'at']

```python
list.insert(2, "Technology")
list.insert(8, "Reston")
' '.join(list)
```
'Fannie Mae Technology office is at Reston'
